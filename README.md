# BUILDING-WITH-ACTIVE-RECORD

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is about building an application similar to Reddit (called Micro-Reddit) where a user can create a post and add comments to it. It is based mainly on the active record, models, and associations to the tests, meaning no user interface has been added.

### Built With
This project was built using these technologies.
* Ruby & Ruby on Rails
* SQLite
* Rubocop
* Stickler
* VSCode

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Usage

To have this app on your pc, you need to:
* have Ruby & Ruby on Rails installed in your computer
* [download](https://github.com/ricardo123321/BUILDING-WITH-ACTIVE-RECORD/archive/feature.zip) or clone this repo:
  - Clone with SSH:
  ```
    git@github.com:ricardo123321/BUILDING-WITH-ACTIVE-RECORD.git
  ```
  - Clone with HTTPS
  ```
    https://github.com/ricardo123321/BUILDING-WITH-ACTIVE-RECORD.git
  ```
* and open the terminal inside the repo and run the bundler
  - ```$ bundler install --without production```
* then, run rails db:migrate. This creates the database with the corresponding tables, columns and associations
